== Install JPF ==

* Install Java PathFinder
  hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-core

* Install the symbolic execution engine
  hg clone http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/hg/jpf/jpf-symbc

* Apply patches
  # jpf-core.patch
  # jpf-symbc.patch

  You have to adapt paths defined in the patch files, because the LSP checker
listener is attached to the Symbolic JPF. Using the listener, we intercept
various calls done by the SUT and decide about its properties.
